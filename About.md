# About this Project
This doc will go over the **W**ho **W**hat **W**hen **W**here and **W**hy of the project. 

## Who

### End Users
Everyone, including businesses, are welcome to use this project. However, the primary audience is individuals who want to share their own files across their own devices without having to worry about handing their data to a closed and proprietary system. 

### Contributors
Anybody who wants to be involved. If you have a suggestion or want to report a bug, feel free to open an issue in the relevant repository. If you have a code change you'd like to submit, feel free to open a PR. Note that the master branch on all repositories under this org is guarded, so any changes you want to see in wild will need a PR.

## What
FLOSS Docs is first and foremost a file-sharing platform. It is attempting to emulate the functionality of similar products such as DropBox and OneDrive. It is open source, so you can extend it to suit your needs. You can audit it to see where you data is going (hint: This is a free project... I can't afford to store your data, or even run it through my own servers!) So long as I can afford it, it will be free as in year. It will always be free as in speech. The open source community has given me a lot, and I want to contribute in my own small way. 

## When
When its done<sup>TM</sup> I aim to have the base done with the core functionality Q1 2020, but I don't know what I don't know so no promises. By core functionality, I mean you can create an account and reliably sync your files between devices.

## Where
While it is tempting to say "everywhere", that is making a commitment I can't keep. Initial efforts will focus on Desktop functionality, however I would very much like to provide mobile offerings in the future. However, the goal is to make this project available to everyone in the world. 

## Why
I didn't find something easy to use that I could trust my data with. Plain and simple.
